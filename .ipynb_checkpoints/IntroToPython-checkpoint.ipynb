Many college level courses include programming in the curriculum, but fail to give students a thorough understanding of the foundation of programming with a particular language. In this guide, I attempt to remedy that, walking the reader through the fundamental points of programming to help the new user become more acclimated with Python.

    "## Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables in programming are not quite the same as what they are for mathematics, but they are not that different. A variable for a computer is a way of storing information that will be recalled later. The way this works is that when a variable is defined, the computer sets aside a block of memory for this information to occupy. That is a simple enough process, but how big is the piece of reserved space in memory? That is defined by the type of the variable. A *** variable type *** is a piece of information that is included in every majorly used program that encodes how large the reserved memory block needs to be, and exactly what type of information it will be holding. It should be noted that programming languages and computers are very particular about information type agreeing with variable type.\n",

    "- Boolean\n",
    "\n",
    "&ast; -these variables are only used in special circumstances when necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Character** type variables are individual letters. These are not used often for the purpose of mathematics.\n",

    "```python\n",
    "my_char = 'a'\n",

    "```python\n",
    "my_int = 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Float** type variables are decimal numbers. The precision of these can vary by programming language: the common types are single, double, and quadruple precision, but double precision is the default for python. Note that there are multiple subcategories (half, single, double, quadruple, and octuple). These refer to the precision of the variable, which encodes how many decimal places it can store. Double is the typical standard for most modern programs, however in scientific computing, both the less precise and the more precise options have uses.\n",

These alphanumeric variables do not hold any value, they are purely visual  variables (the only loophole in this may be ASCII values able to be assigned to each character in a string). The numeric variables, however, hold an exact value at any given time. These values can be utilized in a variety of ways discussed later on.\n",

    "*** Precision ***, in variables, refers to the amount of detail stored in one variable. For numeric values, this is easy to see. A boolean has only two possible values that it can hold: 0 and 1, which makes it the least precise numeric variable.

    "Arrays are a way of grouping together variables, and they exist in one form or another in just about every programming language. The uses for arrays are expansive, as having a way of systematically organizing and indexing variables that should be grouped together is invaluable for efficient programming. \n",

    "In many programming languages, the size of an array must be defined when the array is created and it is not flexible. However, in Python, this is not the case. Python allows for arrays to be dynamically resized as needed and will automatically accomodate elements being added or removed so long as the computer has available memory space.\n",

    "Some situations where arrays are required in python:\n",
    "- for loop iterations (covered later on)\n",
    "- plotting/data visualization\n",

    "The new concept that time deals with that space does not is the updating process. The points in space are fixed, they do not shift where they are located. However the reason for time entering a function is for systems that are dynamic. Since the system is not fixed, it requires a variable, like position or temperature, being updated with each step forward in time.\n",

    "The general rule of thumb is that any time a task needs to be done multiple times the exact same way, or with repetitive varying parameters, the repetitive portion of code should be replaced with a function. Even if something is typed out twice, it could be made more efficient by instead creating a function that can be called in one simple line."

    "\n",
    "Advanced programmers may like to think that they know the answers to whatever arises, but someone that claims to have all the solutions to every problem that may arise is clearly a liar! Most programmers either dabble a little in many languages obtaining a passable proficiency without delving too far into one particular language, or become an expert on one specific language or type of task. \n",
    "\n",
    "For average users, students, professionals, and anybody that isn't an expert in the specific question they're asking, or even an expert that just wants a second opinion, external resources are the key to everything. Programming is a puzzle, and there are many different pathways by which the answer can come about. Since there are so many ways to approach the puzzle, answers, hints, and collaborators are everywhere! \n",
    "\n",
    "Searching for problems through google is undoubtedly the most useful skill programmers know. It allows you to avoid reinventing the wheel or getting stumped by a portion of the code by having access to the thousands of people before you that have been stumped by that issue. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Reading Documentation\n",
    "For many packages in python, and other existing programs have existing documentation online. These documentation pages often include a list of functions included in the package and the arguments each function takes. By searching the name of a particular package on google, one of the first links is usually to the documentation page. Knowing how to use a function and what inputs it takes and outputs it returns are extremely useful for utilizing new packages."
