# Scientific-Python-Primer


This is a resource designed for individuals who have had some experience with
programming languages but have been left out of the loop on the basic
fundamentals of programming with python. In particular this is intended for
science students who often are left in this situation where programming is
required but is never taught from the fundamentals, as it is in many programming
focused curriculums. 


Some important topics that are covered in this are:

- Variables

- Conditional Statements (if, else)

- Loops (for, while)

- Packages

And more that may be helpful to the aspiring scientific programmer.
